- Why are these scripts so simple?

They are here for didactic purposes, not for professional usage. Think they are 
a starting point for you to produce your solid-as-rock derivates.

- Why all the scripts reproduce the same stuff? Is not better to use functions and
  chain scripts to avoid code duplication?

This is not a scripting contest! The idea is that each script must be self contained
and that has to clearly show to the user which commands and statements must be run
in order to produce the final result. Moreover I want scripts to be copy-and-paste
ready to exactly see what is going on without having to open another file or
inspect a function.
