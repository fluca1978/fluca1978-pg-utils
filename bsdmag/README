This directory (and its sub-directories) contain a set of scripts used to explain some PostgreSQL concepts with regard to articles in the BSD Magazine (year 2012).
Each directory is numbered so that you know which directory scripts should be executed 
before the others. Each sub-directory is related to a specific subject or example, the numbering of the sub-directories is not tied to the BSD Magazine issue number. 
Within each directory each script is also numbered, to allow you to see how scripts should
be executed.

Please note that all scripts have been tested on a 9.1 PostgreSQL instance running
on FreeBSD 8.2-RELEASE.
