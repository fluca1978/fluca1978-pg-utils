This directory contains sample files for a quick configuration and test of replication 
between clusters that runs on the same machine. 
Almost every script accepts a number as argument, such number indicates the cluster number. A cluster will be created with such number and the TCP/IP port will be configured
as the master one plus the cluster number.
